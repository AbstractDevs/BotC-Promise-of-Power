# Promise of Power Script

## Townsfolk

### Astrologer

You start knowing 3 roles, two of which are in play.

### Sorcerer

If the Demon kills you, you learn one player of each in-play character type.

### Thaumaturge

Once per game choose a player and a character. If the chosen player is an outsider they become the chosen character.
[+1 Outsider]

### Historian

Each night*, learn the alignment of the first player nominated on the previous day.

### Bonedancer

Each night* - every dead player who voted with you regains their ghost vote.

### Warlock

Each day you may visit the Storyteller to negotiate a pact.

## Outsiders

### Barkeep

One of your neighbors is drunk.

### Ooze

If you die, one or both of your neighbors may become an Ooze & are then poisoned.

### Thug

You can't win. Once per game at night*, chose an alive player. They die and you become their alignment and character. This ability works even if dead.

## Minions

### Prowler

Each night, choose a player: you learn their character. If you choose the same player as the previous night they are poisoned tonight and tomorrow day.

### Trickster

Each night, choose a player: if they would wake you learn their information instead.

(Alternative Option)
Each night, choose a player and a message: the storyteller wakes and tells them the message, this is the only time they wake tonight.

### Plague Herald

When you are nominated, the player who nominated you is poisoned until you are next nominated.

### Doppelganger

On your first night choose a character, you register as that character. Each night chose a player and a character - tonight and tomorrow day they register as that character.

## Demons

### Dragon

Each night*, choose a player: they die. If an Outsider dies today or tonight, choose 1 extra player [+1 Outsider]

### Lich

Each night* choose a player: they die.
You die if and only if all other evil players are dead. If you are executed - choose a player. They die.

### Mob

Each night* all living players choose a living player. Each player with the most votes or tied for the most votes die. Votes for you don't count.


## WIP Concepts/Ideas

### Astronaut - Townsfolk

```
You have an off-script characterâ€™s ability.
```

_This gives the ST a huge amount of power to refine/tweak the game experience for players, but likely is too difficult for players to build worlds around_

### Informant - Townsfolk

```
Each night* you may have a brief private conversation with a player of your choice. You may be an evil minion.
```

_The idea of a confirmable role but non-confirmable alignment seems promising (see: Travellers) but the brief conversation with a player of your choice seems not impactful enough on a game warrent inclusion_
